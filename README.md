# dotfiles

Here you find my favorite dotfiles (the ones I would miss in case my systems get nuked). Feel free to copy, modify, distribute, merge or make fun of them. If the latter is the case I would appreciate tips for improvement.

*Note:* Compatibility is only verified on Arch Linux.

## Getting Started
For a proper ZSH installation please install oh-my-zsh and powerlevel10k to your home directory:
```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k
```
